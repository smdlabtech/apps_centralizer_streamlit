 Question 1: 
#-----------#
The question presents a scenario where you are optimizing BigQuery for a query that is run repeatedly on a single table. The data queried is about 1 GB, and some rows are expected to change about 10 times every hour. After optimizing the SQL statements as much as possible, you want to further optimize the query's performance. The options provided are:

A. Create a materialized view based on the table, and query that view.
B. Enable caching of the queried data so that subsequent queries are faster.
C. Create a scheduled query, and run it a few minutes before the report has to be created.
D. Reserve a larger number of slots in advance so that you have maximum compute power to execute the query.
Given the scenario, where data changes frequently but not continuously, option A is the most effective. Creating a materialized view based on the table can significantly improve query performance because the view precomputes the results, allowing faster access when the query is run. This is especially useful when data changes are not excessively frequent, as in the case where some rows change about 10 times every hour.


Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. Create a materialized view based on the table, and query that view.

 Question 2 : 
#-----------#

The question presents a scenario where a machine learning model built for an e-commerce company has degraded in quality due to significant changes in data patterns caused by a global pandemic. The goal is to improve the quality of the model and prevent future performance degradation. The options provided are:

A. Retrain the model with data from the first 30 days of the lockdown.

B. Monitor data until usage patterns normalize, and then retrain the model.

C. Retrain the model with data from the last 30 days. After one year, return to the older model.

D. Retrain the model with data from the last 30 days. Add a step to continuously monitor model input data for changes, and retrain the model.

Option D is the best choice. This option addresses both the immediate need to update the model with recent data reflecting current user behavior and establishes a continuous monitoring mechanism to detect and adapt to future changes in data patterns. This approach ensures the model remains robust and accurate over time.


Therefore, the correct answer is:
D. Retrain the model with data from the last 30 days. Add a step to continuously monitor model input data for changes, and retrain the model.

 Question 3 : 
#-----------#
The question involves giving access to a MySQL instance on Cloud SQL with an external (public) IP address to a new remote developer, following Google-recommended practices. The options provided are:

A. Ask the developer for their laptop's IP address, and add it to the authorized networks list.

B. Remove the external IP address, and replace it with an internal IP address. Add only the IP address for the remote developer's laptop to the authorized list.

C. Give instance access permissions in Identity and Access Management (IAM), and have the developer run Cloud SQL Auth proxy to connect to a MySQL instance.

D. Give instance access permissions in Identity and Access Management (IAM), change the access to "private service access" for security, and allow the developer to access Cloud SQL from their laptop.

Option C is the most aligned with Google-recommended practices for securing access to Cloud SQL instances. Using IAM for access control and the Cloud SQL Auth proxy enhances security by avoiding the use of IP whitelisting and exposing the instance directly to the internet.


Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. Give instance access permissions in Identity and Access Management (IAM), and have the developer run Cloud SQL Auth proxy to connect to a MySQL instance.

 Question 4 : 
#-----------#

Your Cloud spanner database stores customer address information that is frequently accessed by the marketing team. 
When a customer enters the country and the state where they live, this information is store in different tables connected by a foreign key. 
The current architechture has performance issues.
You want to follow Google-recommended practices to improve performance. What should you do.  

A. Create interleaved tables, and store states under the countries.
B. Denormalize the data, and have a row for each state with its corresponding country.
C. Retain the existing architechture, but use short, two-letter codes for the countries and states.
D. Combine the countries in single cell's text, for example "country: state1, state2, ..." and when required, split data.

 Question 5 : 
#-----------#
Your company runs its business-critical system on PostgreSQL. The system is accessed simultaneously from many locations around the world and supports millions of
customers. Your database administration team manages the redundancy and scaling manually. You want to migrate the database to Google Cloud. 
You need a solution that will provide global scale and availability and require minimal maintenance. What should you do ?

A. Migrate to BigQuery
B. Migrate to Cloud Spanner
C. Migrate to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance
D.
